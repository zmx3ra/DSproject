This paper examines the relationship between Ischemic Stroke 30-Day Mortality and 30-Day Readmission Rates, Hospital Quality Ratings, and Location. (More will be added after data description) (Rachel Kersey)
\end{abstract}

\section{Data Description}
\label{submission}

The dataset name is, “Ischemic Stroke 30-Day Mortality and 30-Day Readmission Rates and Quality Ratings for CA Hospitals.” We got it from Data.gov, which is a reputable source to pull data from. The hyperlink to the dataset is as follows. The purpose of this dataset is to show risk-adjusted 30 day mortality and readmission rates, as well as quality ratings and deaths/readmissions, for Ischemic Strokes treated in hospitals in California. This dataset is important as it shows how hospital ratings are related to stroke readmissions and deaths: and a possible correlation could demonstrate the need for hospitals to increase their ratings in order to lower readmission or death rates. The URL is available here:

\begin{center}
\textbf{\href{https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ischemic-stroke-30-day-mortality-and-30-day-readmission-rates-and-quality-ratings-for-ca-h-92036}{Stroke Dataset Link}}
\end{center}



We investigated a rich dataset with 9 variables: 5 numeric, and 4 categorical. We created a subset to include only the five most populated counties in California. The variables are listed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Year: quantitative discrete, year data was recorded)\@. 
\item County: categorical, county data was recorded in.
\item Hospital: categorical, hospital data was recorded in.
\item OSHPDID: categorical, hospital ID, not important for research question).
\item Risk Adjusted Rate: quantitative continuous (float), risk rate adjusted for age, health severity, readmissions and deaths).
\item Number of Deaths/Readmissions: quantitative continuous (float), number of deaths/readmissions for hospital that year.
\item Number of Cases: quantitative continuous (float), number of hospital cases
\item Hospital Ratings: categorical, patient hospital rating.
\item Location: quantitative (float), hospital location coordinates. (Rachel Kersey)
%\item Keep your abstract brief and self-contained, one paragraph and roughly
%    4--6 sentences. Gross violations will require correction at the
%    camera-ready phase. The title should have content words capitalized.
\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Data Dimensions}

\textbf{Data Dimensions} The size and the shape of the data is 1,026 observations with 9 columns. (Helen Sparling)

\medskip

%Authors must provide their manuscripts in \textbf{PDF} format.
%Furthermore, please make sure that files contain only embedded Type-1 fonts
%(e.g.,~using the program \texttt{pdffonts} in linux or using
%File/DocumentProperties/Fonts in Acrobat). Other fonts (like Type-3)
%might come from graphics files imported into the document.

%Authors using \textbf{Word} must convert their document to PDF\@. Most
%of the latest versions of Word have the facility to do this
%automatically. Submissions will not be accepted in Word format or any
%format other than PDF\@. Really. We're not joking. Don't send Word.

%Those who use \textbf{\LaTeX} should avoid including Type-3 fonts.
%Those using \texttt{latex} and \texttt{dvips} may need the following
%two commands:

%\footnotesize
%\begin{verbatim}
%dvips -Ppdf -tletter -G0 -o paper.ps paper.dvi
%ps2pdf paper.ps
%\end{verbatim}}
%It is a zero following the ``-G'', which tells dvips to use
%the config.pdf file. Newer \TeX\ distributions don't always need this
%option.

%Using \texttt{pdflatex} rather than \texttt{latex}, often gives better
%results. This program avoids the Type-3 font problem, and supports more
%advanced features in the \texttt{microtype} package.

\textbf{Data Quality Notes:} The data had missing values. They were replaced with np.Nan so no additional cleaning was needed. Data cleaning included: coercing columns with periods to numeric as a precaution, removing unnecessary wording, splitting the year column to change the format from "2011-2012" to "2011", and changing the year column to numeric. These changes will make data visualization simpler. There were no unnecessary dollar signs, commas, or other characters. The original data set was quite large, so the 5 most populated counties were subsetted to make the dataset more manageable for analysis. The location column was removed because it was not necessary to answer the research question. (Helen Sparling)


There are some outliers in the dataset. Boxplots were made for the three numeric variables: risk adjusted rate, number of cases, and number of deaths/readmissions. All of these variables were right skewed. Future steps will involve transformations to fix the data and curb the number of outliers. (Rachel Kersey)



\subsection{Context and Relevance}

Our project/goal is to investigate the relationships between year and county and how they relate to risk adjusted rate, deaths, readmissions, and case count. This investigation is important from a public health standpoint, and provides helpful insight into hospital functioning in the California area. Understanding which hospitals have higher deaths and cases, as well as how hospital ratings affect cases, deaths, and re admissions, would help policy makers identify hospitals in need of improvement, and provide recommendations of how to improve patient care. (Helen and Rachel)



\section{Pre-Analysis}

All submissions must follow the specified format.

\subsection{Refined Research Question}




The text of the paper should be formatted in two columns, with an
overall width of 6.75~inches, height of 9.0~inches, and 0.25~inches
between the columns. The left margin should be 0.75~inches and the top
margin 1.0~inch (2.54~cm). The right and bottom margins will depend on
whether you print on US letter or A4 paper, but all final versions
must be produced for US letter size.
Do not write anything on the margins.

The paper body should be set in 10~point type with a vertical spacing
of 11~points. Please use Times typeface throughout the text.

\subsection{Data Splitting Plan}

The paper title should be set in 14~point bold type and centered
between two horizontal rules that are 1~point thick, with 1.0~inch
between the top rule and the top edge of the page. Capitalize the
first letter of content words and put the rest of the title in lower
case.

\subsection{Feature Selection}
\label{author info}

Before running any machine learning, certain variables must be one hot encoded so as to turn a categorical variable into a binary. Variables that were one hot encoded included hospital ratings (where options included worse, as expected, and better) and measure (where options included readmission and mortality). Numerical variables used will include risk adjusted rate, number of deaths/readmission, and number of cases. 

Interactions between variables will be analyzed. We will predict hospital ratings based on multiple variables, both categorical and numeric. These predictor variables are hospital location, year, risk adjusted rate, death, re admissions, and case count. We will do the same for objective 2, using risk adjusted rate as the predicted variable.  

\subsection{Model Selection Plan}

We used a classification model for addressing objective 1 because the predicted variable is categorical. We will use a linear regression model for objective 2 because the predicted variable is numeric. 

Specifically for objective 1, a logistic regression model will be used because the measure variable is a categorical variable. We will also use a K-nearest neighbor for objective 1 because these models can handle categorical targets, categorical predictors so long as they are one-hot encoded (which was done previously). 

Tree based models will be used for objective 2. This will be helpful for making a model with mixed data types (numeric and categorical) without first one-hot encoding. 

\subsection{Evaluation Strategy}

You should organize your paper into sections and paragraphs to help
readers place a structure on the material and understand its
contributions.

\subsubsection{Sections and Subsections}

Section headings should be numbered, flush left, and set in 11~pt bold
type with the content words capitalized. Leave 0.25~inches of space
before the heading and 0.15~inches after the heading.

Similarly, subsection headings should be numbered, flush left, and set
in 10~pt bold type with the content words capitalized. Leave
0.2~inches of space before the heading and 0.13~inches afterward.

Finally, subsubsection headings should be numbered, flush left, and
set in 10~pt small caps with the content words capitalized. Leave
0.18~inches of space before the heading and 0.1~inches after the
heading.

Please use no more than three levels of headings.

\subsubsection{Paragraphs and Footnotes}

Within each section or subsection, you should further partition the
paper into paragraphs. Do not indent the first line of a given
paragraph, but insert a blank line between succeeding ones.

You can use footnotes\footnote{Footnotes
should be complete sentences.} to provide readers with additional
information about a topic without interrupting the flow of the paper.
Indicate footnotes with a number in the text where the point is most
relevant. Place the footnote in 9~point type at the bottom of the
column in which it appears. Precede the first footnote in a column
with a horizontal rule of 0.8~inches.\footnote{Multiple footnotes can
appear in each column, in the same order as they appear in the text,
but spread them across columns and pages if possible.}

produced, the number of accepted papers for ICML 2008 was unknown and instead
estimated.}
\label{icml-historical}
\end{center}
\vskip -0.2in
\end{figure}

\subsection{Figures}

You may want to include figures in the paper to illustrate
your approach and results. Such artwork should be centered,
legible, and separated from the text. Lines should be dark and at
least 0.5~points thick for purposes of reproduction, and text should
not appear on a gray background.

Label all distinct components of each figure. If the figure takes the
form of a graph, then give a name for each axis and include a legend
that briefly describes each curve. Do not include a title inside the
figure; instead, the caption should serve this function.

Number figures sequentially, placing the figure number and caption
\emph{after} the graphics, with at least 0.1~inches of space before
the caption and 0.1~inches after it, as in
\cref{icml-historical}. The figure caption should be set in
9~point type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which
case it should be flush left. You may float figures to the top or
bottom of a column, and you may set wide figures across both columns
(use the environment \texttt{figure*} in \LaTeX). Always place
two-column figures at the top or bottom of the page.

\subsection{Algorithms}

If you are using \LaTeX, please use the ``algorithm'' and ``algorithmic''
environments to format pseudocode. These require
the corresponding stylefiles, algorithm.sty and
algorithmic.sty, which are supplied with this package.
\cref{alg:example} shows an example.

\begin{algorithm}[tb]
   \caption{Bubble Sort}
   \label{alg:example}
\begin{algorithmic}
   \STATE {\bfseries Input:} data $x_i$, size $m$
   \REPEAT
   \STATE Initialize $noChange = true$.
   \FOR{$i=1$ {\bfseries to} $m-1$}
   \IF{$x_i > x_{i+1}$}
   \STATE Swap $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$
   \STATE $noChange = false$
   \ENDIF
   \ENDFOR
   \UNTIL{$noChange$ is $true$}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Tables}

You may also want to include tables that summarize material. Like
figures, these should be centered, legible, and numbered consecutively.
However, place the title \emph{above} the table with at least
0.1~inches of space before the title and the same after it, as in
\cref{sample-table}. The table title should be set in 9~point
type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which case it
should be flush left.

% Note use of \abovespace and \belowspace to get reasonable spacing
% above and below tabular lines.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{sc}
\end{small}
\end{center}
\vskip -0.1in
\end{table}

Tables contain textual material, whereas figures contain graphical material.
Specify the contents of each row and column in the table's topmost
row. Again, you may float tables to a column's top or bottom, and set
wide tables across both columns. Place two-column tables at the
top or bottom of the page.

\subsection{Theorems and such}
The preferred way is to number definitions, propositions, lemmas, etc. consecutively, within sections, as shown below.
\begin{definition}
\label{def:inj}
A function $f:X \to Y$ is injective if for any $x,y\in X$ different, $f(x)\ne f(y)$.
\end{definition}
Using \cref{def:inj} we immediate get the following result:
\begin{proposition}
If $f$ is injective mapping a set $X$ to another set $Y$, 
the cardinality of $Y$ is at least as large as that of $X$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} 
Left as an exercise to the reader. 
\end{proof}
\cref{lem:usefullemma} stated next will prove to be useful.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:usefullemma}
For any $f:X \to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ injective functions, $f \circ g$ is injective.
\end{lemma}
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:bigtheorem}
If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, the cardinality of $X$ and $Y$ are the same.
\end{theorem}
An easy corollary of \cref{thm:bigtheorem} is the following:
\begin{corollary}
If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, 
the cardinality of $X$ is at least as large as that of $Y$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{assumption}
The set $X$ is finite.
\label{ass:xfinite}
\end{assumption}
\begin{remark}
According to some, it is only the finite case (cf. \cref{ass:xfinite}) that is interesting.
\end{remark}
%restatable

\subsection{Citations and References}

Please use APA reference format regardless of your formatter
or word processor. If you rely on the \LaTeX\/ bibliographic
facility, use \texttt{natbib.sty} and \texttt{icml2025.bst}
included in the style-file package to obtain this format.

Citations within the text should include the authors' last names and
year. If the authors' names are included in the sentence, place only
the year in parentheses, for example when referencing Arthur Samuel's
pioneering work \yrcite{Samuel59}. Otherwise place the entire
reference in parentheses with the authors and year separated by a
comma \cite{Samuel59}. List multiple references separated by
semicolons \cite{kearns89,Samuel59,mitchell80}. Use the `et~al.'
construct only for citations with three or more authors or after
listing all authors to a publication in an earlier reference \cite{MachineLearningI}.

Authors should cite their own work in the third person
in the initial version of their paper submitted for blind review.
Please refer to \cref{author info} for detailed instructions on how to
cite your own papers.

Use an unnumbered first-level section heading for the references, and use a
hanging indent style, with the first line of the reference flush against the
left margin and subsequent lines indented by 10 points. The references at the
end of this document give examples for journal articles \cite{Samuel59},
conference publications \cite{langley00}, book chapters \cite{Newell81}, books
\cite{DudaHart2nd}, edited volumes \cite{MachineLearningI}, technical reports
\cite{mitchell80}, and dissertations \cite{kearns89}.

Alphabetize references by the surnames of the first authors, with
single author entries preceding multiple author entries. Order
references for the same authors by year of publication, with the
earliest first. Make sure that each reference includes all relevant
information (e.g., page numbers).

Please put some effort into making references complete, presentable, and
consistent, e.g. use the actual current name of authors.
If using bibtex, please protect capital letters of names and
abbreviations in titles, for example, use \{B\}ayesian or \{L\}ipschitz
in your .bib file.

\section*{Accessibility}
Authors are kindly asked to make their submissions as accessible as possible for everyone including people with disabilities and sensory or neurological differences.
Tips of how to achieve this and what to pay attention to will be provided on the conference website \url{http://icml.cc/}.

\section*{Software and Data}

If a paper is accepted, we strongly encourage the publication of software and data with the
camera-ready version of the paper whenever appropriate. This can be
done by including a URL in the camera-ready copy. However, \textbf{do not}
include URLs that reveal your institution or identity in your
submission for review. Instead, provide an anonymous URL or upload
the material as ``Supplementary Material'' into the OpenReview reviewing
system. Note that reviewers are not required to look at this material
when writing their review.

% Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
\section*{Acknowledgements}

\textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
the paper submitted for blind review.

If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
usually should) include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements
should be placed at the end of the section, in an unnumbered section
that does not count towards the paper page limit. Typically, this will 
include thanks to reviewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues 
who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate 
sponsors that provided financial support.

\section*{Impact Statement}

Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential 
broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future 
societal consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered 
section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- 
the two may appear in either order, but both must be before References), 
and does not count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where 
the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that 
are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, 
substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such 
as the following will suffice:

``This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.''

The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we 
encourage authors to think about whether there is content which does 
warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the 
paper is later flagged for ethics review.


% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite
\nocite{langley00}
